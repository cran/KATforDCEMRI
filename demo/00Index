KAT	Analyzes a simulated two-slice DCE-MRI data set generated using the extended Tofts model with parameters set to Ktrans=0.28 1/min, kep=1.7 1/min, vb=0.05 for slice 1 and Ktrans=0.54 1/min, kep=2.3 1/min, vb=0.08 for slice 2. For each voxel, random variability was added to each model parameter: 15% for slice 1 and 25% for slice 2.  An additional layer of noise was added to each simulated data point: 15% for slice 1 and 20% for slice 2.
